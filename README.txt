TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

in the terminal go to the bin folder and run java Main.
The first line should be "START OF PROGRAM".
Running all programs take time, they all are search algorithms.
For the sake of brevity the program only outputs the number of states visited,
it does not display the initial state and the actions needed to reach a goal state.
If it did, the output would be long and messy. The main file can be changed to show
this results.

This program was created for a course in artifical intelligence at UTRGV.
This program implements 3 search algorithms: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search,
and A* search.
